# Drag and Release

A simple drag-and-drop feature for positioning a `div` element within a container. This allows users to click and drag a `div` element to move it around, then release it at a new location.

## Setup Instructions for Windows

Open **Command Prompt** (or **PowerShell**) and run the following command:

1.Clone The Repository
  ->git clone https://github.com/username/repository-name.git
2. Install Dependencies
  ->cd repo-name
  ->npm install
3.Run the Application
  ->click on the live server

##Technology Choices

Technologies are used based of the company's instruction i.e HTML, CSS and Vanilla JavaScript.

##Known Limitations

The drag-and-drop feature is implemented in pure JavaScript without any optimization for large numbers of draggable items. With many draggable elements on screen, performance could degrade due to the direct DOM manipulation during drag events.


##Future Improvements

Allow users to customize the look and feel of the draggable div and container (e.g., adding themes, custom CSS classes). Use the third party library for the better animation and styling.
